    <h3>A concrete (and crystalline) solution to preserve concrete infrastructures</h3>

    <p>
      In a world where building with concrete has become the norm, 
      we questioned the durability of this construction material which, 
      after several decades, shows signs of weakening. The main challenge 
      is to anticipate the formation of cracks in the concrete. To achieve 
      this, we had to find a material capable of changing color when mechanical 
      deformation occurs: liquid crystals. We studied them and then determined 
      the conditions under which their unique optical properties can be observed. 
      Beyond simply predicting cracks, we aimed to find an effective method to 
      prevent the aging of concrete caused by acidification. After subjecting 
      concrete to accelerated aging, we implemented a regeneration system using 
      cathodic protection. While this process proves effectiveness on a small scale, 
      it nevertheless shows limitations when it comes to applying it to large scale structures.
